This repo is mainly for my dissertation， Understanding the Racial Bias of Stop and Search in Greater London. 
Through point pattern analysis via DBSCAN and disproportionality analysis, this study provides evidence of potential racial discrimination in police use of stop and search powers to specific boroughs and MSOA; and further explores factors that could explain the local variation of stop and search arrest rate by Geographically Weighted Regression and local Moran’s I maps.
